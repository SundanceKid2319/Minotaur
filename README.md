# Minotaur
 
Controls:

Arrows or wasd to move.
Space to use sword and interact with objects.
M to use the bow [although currently the box collider sometimes injures the player as well]
J to travel through the stairs.

The log and ogre NPCs are fully developed.
I was not able to get several puzzles coded the way I wanted so they are present but only set up to view and not interact with.
The more interesting characters that take on the theme of the greek laberynth simply have animations attached to them. I didn't have time to create boss fights whcih I would love to add eventually.
Other than that I believe the maze is fully solveable, Im just a little bummed out that I didn't have time to code the mechanisms of the more intricate puzzles and the boss fights. But this is my first time working in Unity and I accomplished more than I thought I could.

Thank you!
